        "#About this notebook\n",
        "\n",
        "This notebook is implements and evaluates the STORM model, which stands for [Stochastic Transformer-based wORld Model](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=WxnrX42rnS). The STORM model is a reinforcement learning architecture that efficiently combines the sequence modeling power of transformers with the stochastic nature of variational autoencoders to enhance agent performance in complex environments.\n",
        "\n",
        "Key Features of This Notebook:\n",
        "- Repository Cloning and Setup: The notebook starts by cloning the official STORM repository, installing necessary dependencies, and setting up the environment for running the model.\n",
        "- Model Checkpoint Management: It includes downloading and decompressing model checkpoints that are essential for evaluating the STORM model's performance.\n",
        "- Evaluation Script Creation: The notebook creates a custom Python evaluation script that sets up the environment, loads the trained world model and agent, and evaluates the agent's performance by generating a video of its actions within the environment.\n",
        "- Execution and Output: The notebook concludes by running the evaluation script and saving the output video, which visualizes the agent's behavior and performance within the selected environment.\n",
        "\n",
        "Context of STORM:\n",
        "The STORM model is an advanced approach in model-based reinforcement learning, where a parameterized simulation model of the environment is constructed through self-supervised learning. This model helps the agent improve its policy without constantly relying on real environment samples, making training more efficient.\n",
        "\n",
        "Performance:\n",
        "STORM sets a new benchmark with a mean human performance of 126.7% on the Atari 100k benchmark, and its efficient training process makes it highly practical for real-world applications.\n",
